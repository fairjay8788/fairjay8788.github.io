# Portfolio Mockup I

![Screen Shot](../img/ssportfolioMU1.jpg)

Mockup of a simple portfolio website.

I found this portfolio site clean and pretty [here](http://dennisivy-portfolio.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/index.html?name=&subject=&email=&message=). Actually this is how I got the idea of giving my own portfolio site a light/dark switching appearance. It's also fully responsive. [Check it out](https://fairjay8788.github.io/portfolioMU1/).
