# Panda Buffet

Website for local restaurant.

When I first saw the background image of the landing page, I felt so hungry. Yes, that's almost the entire reason why I built this. If I see a real website like this for a real restaurant, I will go grab a bite. I like the design of the website navigation menu, which feels like a door. It's a good fit for a chinese restaurant website. [Check it out](https://fairjay8788.github.io/restaurant/).
