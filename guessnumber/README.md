# Number Guessing Game

![Screen Shot](../img/ssnumbergame.jpg)

This is my first vanilla javascript game.

This project is inspired by a little game I played as a kid. It's easy to understand the rules, but quite difficult to get the right number in 10 guesses. It requires not only logical thinking, but also a bit of luck. Give it a try [here](https://fairjay8788.github.io/guessnumber/).
