            Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
          </div>
          <div class="intro-piece">
            In this game, you have 10 chances to guess a four-digit number. They
            are four differnt digits, so the answer won't be like 6666, or 1212.
            Please note the first digit could be 0.
          </div>
          <div class="intro-piece">
            After confirming each answer, you will see how good was your guess
            in the right panel. "xA" means among the four digits you guessed, x
            of them are correct for BOTH number and position. "yB" means y of
            the digits are ONLY correct for number.
          </div>
          <div class="intro-piece">
            For example, if the answer is 0239 and your guess is 1309, the
            result would be "1A2B" since your correctly guessed "9" to be fourth
            digit (1A) and you are also right that "0" and "3" are in the answer
            but not the correct position (2B). If you could get a "4A0B" guess
            in 10 tries, you win the game!
          </div>
          <div class="intro-piece">
            After a few guesses, you will become more and more sure what numbers
            are in the answer. Based on your guess history, with luck and your
            high IQ, you will beat the game.
          </div>
          <div class="intro-piece">
            If you feel this is too difficult, don't forget you have and only
            have 1 hint. Use it wisely<br />
            It can be a real chanllege. Are you up to it?
