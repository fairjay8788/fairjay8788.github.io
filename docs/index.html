          <p>
            My name is Jie Wu. My friends call me Jay. I'm a web developer. I
            studied electrical engineering in Auburn, AL and software
            engineering in Minneapolis, MN. I also stayed in Toronto Canada for
            4 years before I came back to US with my wife in 2016.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I will try to update my portfolio every week. If some of my works
            seem to be very simple, it's because they are. I will add more
            complex projects as I learn new skills and find more time.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I like coding, movie, music, games and everything I do together with
            my family. I now lives in Rochester MN with my wife and our dog,
            waiting for our first baby boy to come.

              These are landing page mockups. When I browse through popular
              landing page templates, I find some of them pretty and attactive.
              I will build them in my way without checking their source.
              Sometimes I make minor changes, so my mockups and the original
              wouldn't be exactly the same. I will include a link to the
              original template in each of these pages.

              Although most of the works here don't really communicate with
              back-end (yet), they are user-interactive projects. I started by
              building little games. I find it to be the most fun category to
              build in this portfolio, because I love games. Later on, I began
              to make applications for easy daily tasks. Most ideas come from
              myself, while some of them are inspired by the internet. I will
              include a link to my inspiration in the page if there is one.

              I'm always learning, so is my portfolio evolving. Not only do I
              add more works to it weekly (hopefully), I also change the look of
              this portfolio from time to time. It may not get updated as often
              as other project categories, but when I feel boring of the same
              look some day, it will happen. Here are history versions of my
              portfolio site. The more recent works are not included in history
              versions. I will try to remember to make sure all the links work.
